In September 2015, world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly pledged to drastically transform the world by 2030. Poor people, homeless parents with children are seen living in horrible conditions. While many are blessed with food on the table, millions are still struggling to manage one square meal for their families. We at Annapurna are determined to help the hungry by bringing them to a place where they would not have to feel like going to bed on an empty stomach.

## WHO ARE WE

We at Annapurna plan to make a portal where different banquet halls, party halls, etc. where a lot of food is wasted and connect them to the people who can’t even afford 2 square meals a day. We plan to minimize food wastage and connect those in need.

## WHY JOIN US

According to FAO estimates in ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2020 report, 189.2 million people are undernourished in India. By this measure, 14% of the population is undernourished in India. We plan to change this. However, to tackle this problem, we need support from NGOs all over the country to help in distribution of food from various sources.

The total number of slots available for a hall is published by individual halls on a daily basis. Each user has 6 Tokens in total. A user can choose to visit any location and this would cost 1 token, in exchange they get a ticket for the given slot. This way users can book slots.

Currently, about 189.6 million people in India go to bed without two square meals a day. We plan to tackle this by creating a portal where people can book slots for party halls and banquets. We plan to minimize food wastage and connect those in need.

Our app works on the concept of bringing those who require food to the institutions that are willing to give it. We have used the concepts of Web3, polygon, Moralis, Metamask wallet, MongoDB to implement the backbone and the backend of the project.

To do this, we would require support from Local NGOs, to help the people get added to the platform and to assist them in getting tokens and tickets. These tickets are presented as NFTs which are minted for the user and can be used for verification.

### Technologies

Tailwind CSS, React, Next.JS, MongoDB, Polygon, MetaMask, HardHat, Web3, Figma

### Challenges we ran into

The challenges were big but not unsolvable. Due to this idea having very big aspirations and goals, we achieved major milestones in our project and the entire team learned a lot along the way.

- We had to learn the working of smart contracts and how web3 actually works.
- Using Moralis to implement the Web3 infrastructure.
- Generating and posting NFTs in a way its authenticity can be maintained.
- A robust design to encompass the whole idea of the platform.
- Creating a strong logistic strategy to get people to the food and not let it go to waste.
